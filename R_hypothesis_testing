## the above testing is assume the population variance is known, but it is rarely the case when we practice.
## alomost in all the cases, we have t estiamte the population variance using the sample variance
## when we use the sample variance, we calculate the t-scores and use the t-distribution\
## t_score = (sample_mean - population_mean)/sample_sd/sqrt(sample_size)
## when we have the t_score, we can use pt() fucntion in R to calculate the probability
## This is the single sample t-test, the following result is the same as the result on page 189
pt(5.33, df = 199, lower.tail = F)

## if we need one side t-test, we should set the alternative parameter to "greater" or "less"
