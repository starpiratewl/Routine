Hopes that liberalising reforms would breathe new life into India's economy may have permeated the air since Modi swept to power as prime minister in May 2014.

The complicated version will probably yield less than half that and only after a painful transition

When Mr Modi was elected many business leaders winced at the sectarian and polarising bent of his BJP.

minimum government, maximum governance

Three years on, those hopes are fading

They thought he was the leader to rekindle the short-lived enthusiasm for liberalisation of 1991, when India faced bankruptcy.

They hoped that the state apparatus would be aimed away from trying to do everything(often badly) and towards providing basic services

Mr Modi has shown that he is an astute administrator of the economic machinery he inherited.

Corruption seems to have abated, at least at the highest levels of government.

But he has demonstrated little appetite for the reforms which would bring sustained growth of the sort that could transform the lives of India's 1.3 bn citizens.

The few Mr Modi has carried out must be weighed against those he has botched, the areas that have gone without reform, and the sticking plasters that cover up the effects of bad policy rather than deal with their causes.

Mr Modi does deserve credit for bringing macroeconomic stability.
